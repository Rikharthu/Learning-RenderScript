Context
A Context has for RenderScript the same meaning that it has for an
Android Activity. RenderScript scripts initialized inside the same context
will be able to access the same Allocations.

Script
RenderScript code is written into compilable files, which use a C99
programming language variant (having extensions .rs, .fs).
Allocation

A RenderScript allocation is a class that interfaces with a memory
allocation (the one you create using the C malloc function) where you can
store your scripts’ data. An allocation is defined by a root element (which
tells RS what kind of data you are storing inside the allocation) and the
count of those elements.

Kernel
A RenderScript kernel is a function applied to every allocation’s element
and does calculations over it.

Type
A RenderScript Type defines which kind of basic element an allocation has
(e.g. int) and the dimensions of the allocation itself (like x, y and z).
